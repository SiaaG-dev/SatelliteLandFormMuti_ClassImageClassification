# SatelliteLandFormMuti_ClassImageClassification
Satellite Landform Image Detection with Multiclass Identification with MLRSNet
In a team of 4, developed an architecture to classify satellite images using transfer learning for AlexNet and SVM models as a baseline. Worked with medium (10k) to large (64k) sized datasets and compared it to the final EfficientNetB2 architecture. Used Adaptive Median Filter (AMF) to reduce noise on satellite images. Qualitative Analysis (Confusion Matrix, visualizing kernels), and Quantitative Results (validation/training curves, hyperparameter testing). The modified EfficientNetB2 model achieved a 96% test accuracy at 0.1 test loss. 
Integrated the backend EfficientNetB2 model to the interactive website (integration with Google Colab).
